### Java Introduction:

1. **What is Java?**
      - Java is a high-level, object-oriented, platform-independent programming language.
      - It is used to build reliable, secure, and portable software applications.


      | 🔸 **Concept**                  | 🔹 **Summary / Purpose**                                     |
      |-------------------------------  |--------------------------------------------------------------|
      | **1) High-Level Language**     | Easy to read/write, uses English-like words                 |
      |                                | 📌 Makes programming human-friendly                          |
      | **2) OOPs (Object-Oriented)**  | Uses classes & objects, supports Encapsulation, etc.        |
      |                                | 📌 Helps in code reuse, organization, and security           |
      | **3) Platform Independent**    | Code runs on any OS (Windows, Linux, etc.)                  |
      |                                | 📌 *Write once, run anywhere* (done via JVM + bytecode)      |
      | **4) JVM (Java Virtual Machine)** | Runs `.class` bytecode on any system                     |
      |                                | 📌 Converts bytecode → machine code, adds portability        |
      | **5) Compiler (Java)**         | Reads full code at once, creates bytecode                   |
      |                                | 📌 Not like Python (line by line); prepares code for JVM     |
